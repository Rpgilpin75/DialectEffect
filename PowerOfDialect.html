							<p>Prior to delving into this discussion on the power of the Catalan language it is worth noting that much of the arguments being discussed are derived from some of the other segments of the website. It may be worth your while to take a look at some of the History content because I intend to draw from those earlier discussions to drive home several key points. To skip back a step and read up on the history of Catalunya please visit these pages <a href="pre-integration.html">here</a>.</p>
							<hr><h3> A Symbol of the Region</h3>
							<p>Throughout the history of Catalunya, the power of its regional dialect was clearly depicted in the actions of those who sought to oppress their regionalist spirit.
							</p>
							<p>The first time in which its power was inadvertently recognized was at the end of the Spanish war of succession and the beginning of the 18th century and the reign of King Philip V and his Nueva Planta Decree (full discussion <a href="SeedsofDiscontent.html">here</a>). While the Nueva Planta Decree was intended on displacing the regional government, the abolishment of Catalan as an administrative language was, in my opinion, its greatest blow. What the removal of Catalan was intended to do was to remove the legitimacy of any non-state sponsored movements of any kind. Any potential revolutionary movements or ideas proposed by a group of Catalan citizens or parliamentary officials would immediately be denounced as illegitimate if written in Catalan, which many would have been to preserve the identity and integrity of what they were attempting to change. This primary removal of Catalan was extremely damaging to the identity of the region.</p>
							<p>This was only the start of the suppression of Catalan in both official and social capacities and while it experienced a loosening of cultural restraints in the 19th century, because of the work of the Lliga and Republicanes, the 20th was the start of a darker age for Catalan.  Understanding that these Catalan political parties could effectively lobby their demands to the national courts, and the damaging economic effects of World War I, dictator Miguel Primo de Rivera took a more authoritarian control over national operations. In order to bring that post-war chaos to a minimum, Rivera needed to quell social as well as national imbalances. This balancing of national affairs removed Catalan from cultural use, specifically in churches and church services. This suppression only increased at the end of the Spanish Civil War as the Franco Regime came to power. His primary initiative, as mentioned in the history segment, was to suppress any group who opposed him politically during the conflict. This, again, included the complete illegality of the Catalan language and all Catalan cultural events in addition to their political autonomy.</p>
							<p>These first two suppressions of the Catalan language are crucial in limiting the power of the region as a whole. It effectively removed Catalan from both government and religion as a means of suppressing the ability for potential separatists to meet and congregate. As a country with a strong focus on religion the next place any potential revolutionary would consider turning to as an attempt to change their country would be the church.  Having outlawed the language of the revolution, for lack of a better word, they have removed the legitimacy of planning such a radical change in such an integral focal point of their cultural identity. Now in two places, the illegal use of Catalan has limited the ability for any potential organization to demand their independence as they had done since the founding of the earliest organization as a formal country. The third suppression, during the Franco regime, all but confirmed the power of Catalan in the scope of the nationâ€™s politics. It was the center point of the Catalan identity and that was evident by the decisions made by any who attempted to remove the legitimacy of any Catalan independence movements throughout the history of the region. Language was always among the first to go, in every instance, because it was what gave legitimacy to each attempt at independence, not only because it was unique for the country itself, but because it was one of the few dialects that so clearly distinguished between Castellano and Catalan simply through convention and pronunciation alone.</p>
							<p>Moving past how Catalan history and the suppression of language has impacted the region and its separatist sentiments, its present, with language and culture in bloom have sparked changes on the national level that could greatly impact the future of Spain. As discussed in the Modern Politics segment of the website, there are very few differences between the secessionary movements in Texas and in Catalunya. So why was it that one, and not the other has gained traction and moved toward actual successful secession? Again I turn to language as the answer.</p>
							<p>Texas shares, in its completeness, a language with its governing nation, and while it is influenced by Latin American immigrants to the south, they have not changed the culture of Texas to accept Spanish as its official language. English is a language spoken around the world and is the official language of several countries, and every state in the union. It is a unifying measure nationally, and while Texans have their incredible state pride, it is dwarfed by national pride toward international relations. Essentially what I am getting at is that the English language is not symbolic of Texas in any informal capacity. Catalan on the other hand is the most obvious symbol of the Catalan identity. It stands apart in Castellano dominated Spain through the voices of its people. </p>
							<p>The effect that this dialect has on the region and country as a whole is astounding in that it allows a group of seemingly different people under the banner of simple sound and phonetics. As I studied in Barcelona, the capital of Catalunya, and attempted to communicate in Castellano to the various shopkeepers and vendors that I interacted with I was often corrected and given the Catalan way of saying whatever phrase it was that I had used. Even as a tourist, and believe me they knew I was a tourist, anyone with a polite correction and a smile made sure to let you know how to be one of them. Even I, an outsider to this culture felt a part of it every day that I was there. I would greet the baker in the Catalan the he had taught me every morning as I went for my breakfast and felt as a sense of belonging in that place. This happened all over the city, and by the end of my time there I could understand what made this region of the world so capable of changing the course of their future; their language. A dialect that made me, a student of traditional Castellano Spanish, feel like a Catalan native, and having walked away only knowing a few quips and phrases, it astounded me how one I felt with the place I had lived for only a few months. I do not speak Catalan, I cannot read it, I cannot write it, and I can understand very little of it, but what I do understand is how proud every Catalan citizen is to be Catalan and how willing they are to share that culture with you through the merits of their language. </p>
							<p>This unity, this oneness, the missing piece to the formula for modern political revolution and secession, is all linked to the Catalan identity, which would struggle to exist without its dialect. It differentiates Catalunya from national Spain, unites its people under the common banner of Catalan, and shows the world that it is truly fitting of its distinction as a sovereign nation should its people vote to have it be so. This is the power of the Catalan dialect and who knows, we may soon see a sovereign Catalunya as a result.</p>
