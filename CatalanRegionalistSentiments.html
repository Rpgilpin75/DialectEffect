								<h3>The Rise of Catalan Regionalism</h3>
								<p>Conflicts throughout the history of Catalunya has driven sentiments away from their Spanish national identities and into a more regionally focused identity. This was never more evident than in the 19th and 20th centuries, where it reigned as the forefront of Spanish industrialization and was even considered the site of a cultural movement. Most importantly however, during this time there was a movement to revive the culture and language taken from them by the Nueva Planta decrees almost two-hundred years earlier.</p>
								<p>This movement started with the foundation of The Lliga Regionalista, a political party used to articulate the demands of the Catalan region to the national parliament in Madrid, in 1901. This group was formed on notions described in the 1892 document called the The Bases de Manresa which argued several things. First and foremost that Catalunya was its own independent nation. Second that it should have its own Parliament to govern it, third to have its own laws to dispense justice as they see fit, and finally their own language. One thing that must be understood however is that they did not at that time look to secede but instead called for a greater autonomy from the governing regime of Spain at that time. This idea of a political party sporting the ideals of Catalan regionalism and bringing them into Madrid spurred a movement throughout Catalunya that this type of change was a possibility.</p>
								<p>After twelve years the Lligaâ€™s persistence in the parliament in Madrid paid off with the passing of the Mancomunitat in 1914. This statute allowed an administrative union comprised of the four provinces that made up Catalunya to preserve and promote the heritage, art, and culture of the region. In addition to these provisions it also promoted the creation of literary works written in Catalan to spread their language. While it was not the autonomy they had truly desired it was a way to receive the cultural and historical recognition since their being brought under direct control of Madrid in the late 17th early 18th century. This, while wonderful in the eyes of Catalan Citizens, did not appease their desires for autonomy.</p>
								<p>Despite their progress, during the dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera which began in 1923 it seemed as if it had all been for naught. Primo came to power to bring order to an unstable Spain, a result of post-World War I economic difficulties that left Spain with a crippled economy and limited infrastructure development. However, the price of this order was the suppression of the separatist movement in Barcelona, which resulted in their Language being made illegal in churches and also made cultural events such as the sardana also illegal. Essentially making Catalan culture publicly illegal.</p>
