								<h3>History's Turbulent Turn</h3>
								<p>After Catalunya lost favor as the principle Spanish port starting with the discovery of the “New World” there began an era of discontent between the Catalan people and the Spanish Monarchy. The first of which is known by several names, the “Catalan Revolt”, or the “Reaper’s War.”</p>
								<p>Before looking into the impact of the Catalan Revolt, we must first understand the frameworks in place in Spain that caused this discontent to erupt into conflict. It is in fact fairly simple. After the marriage of Ferdinand and Isabella, the two monarchs retained unified but separate regional governments. Because of this, Catalunya did not pay taxes to the Monarchy’s imperial ventures. There were several other differences between the two regions from language that was not understood in Castilla and the Catalan political structure that loosely mimicked feudal France. </p>
								<p>In the 1620s and 30s King Philip IV of Spain, with the help of the Count-Duke of Olivares continued to engage themselves in three wars: the Thirty Years War, a war with the Dutch, and a war with France. </p>
								<hr />

								<h4>The Catalan Revolt</h4>
								<p>This specific conflict is vitally important to understanding Catalan regional sentiments towards its nationalist governments, both past and present, because it is the first time in which their pseudo-independence since their incorporation in which their regional freedoms were challenge.</p>
								<p>Because of their multiple engagements engagements both Philip IV and Oliviares looked to the entirety of states under the Spanish monarchy to pay its “fair share” in the form of increased taxes; something that the Catalan people refused. As war continued to grow between Spain and France, Catalunya found itself at the center of bloody battles and increased persistence by its own government to pay. Spain decided to fight this war on Catalan soil to force their hand in financing the conflict. France captured the Catalan fort at Salses which Spain fought to reclaim, which it did, but resulted in the loss of Catalunya.</p>
								<p>Because of the actions of their monarchy, the destruction of their region, and the deaths of their troops, dissenting officials, priests and regional patriots riled the masses. Pau Claris, a patriot himself was elected president of their regional government. Discontent between Catalunya and its monarchy steadily grew from this point on with continual political and punitive actions being taken by both sides until, in response to the arrest of a Catalan political figure, rebels fought back.</p>
								<p>The revolt began with armed peasants attacking and reclaiming the Catalan countryside. The peasants fought the rich who imposed these taxes, Catalan or Castillano alike while Catalunya turned to their French neighbors for help in combating the monarchy in Castilla and Aragon. After a military stalemate from 1643-1648 until the Spanish monarch’s conflicts the Thirty Years’ War and the Dutch revolt ended allowing them to devote their attention to their home conflict, and the Fronde breaking out forcing the French to withdraw their support from Catalunya. Ultimately leading to the starvation and surrender of Barcelona in 1652.</p>
								<p>Philip IV issued an amnesty and the Catalan legal and political systems were allowed to perisist. Even though Phillip IV was lenient on his punitive action toward Catalunya, significant negative emotions remained. </p>
								<hr>

								<h4>The War of Spanish Succession</h4>
								<p>In 1701 discontent between Catalunya and Castilla grew to yet another conflict spurred by the death of King Charles II of Spain died without an heir. This conflict, considered in part one of the first multinational wars of the near modern era.  There were two principle claimants that divided Spain into two loyalties. First, those regions loyal to Castilla supported the claim by Louis XIV of France who appointed his grandson a Spanish native himself to rule in his place. The thrown was bestowed upon Louis XIV by King Charles II of Spain in his will. Catalunya in turn supported the claim put forward by Archduke Charles, or Charles III of Spain, due to strong French resentment after an attack on Barcelona in 1697.</p>
								<p>The war ended with yet another failed revolt, of sorts, against the Castillano nationalism for Catalunya. This time, the monarchy was not as lenient as Philip IV had been, and Philip V, the newly appointed king of Spain, suppressed its parliament and traditional liberties that it had maintained throughout their initial incorporation with united Spain.</p>
								<hr>
								
								<h4>Nueva Planta Decree</h4>
								<p>Two years after the end of the war of Spanish Succession Philip V completed and published a set of decrees known as the Nueva Planta Decree. These decrees set-up a provisional governing administration within Catalunya over which he had appointed José Patiño to preside. This decree served the purpose of the complete, yet subtle, destruction of the Catalunya’s legislative and governing group. It helped place institutions that supported the monarchy of Philip V.</p>
								<p>Philip V did not only abolish the institutions already present in Catalunya, but also injected its own independently controlled government that removed potential revolutionaries from their regional government system. Because of these governmental changes, Catalunya was brought under direct administrative control of Madrid, the seat of the Philip V regime. Finally, and most interesting to me due to my background in language, this decree abolished the use of the Catalan dialect as an administrative language. While this linguistic change did not affect the social use of Catalan, it was used as a means of removing Catalunya’s most distinct unifying measure, its language, from official use effectively creating a different shade of the Spanish rule of Philip V. </p>
