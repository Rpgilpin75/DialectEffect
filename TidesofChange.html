								<h3>Modern Movements</h3>
								<p>Today Catalunya is the hotbed of one of the world’s most public independence movements Europe has seen in a long time. What they are hoping to do, after a long history fighting for autonomy from various national governing parties, is to rid themselves of all Spanish national ties and secede. This movement began with the economic crisis beginning in 2008 which hit Spain hard in 2009. It was in this year that those in favor of a sovereign Catalan nation begin holding a series of informal votes on the region’s independence in all cities and towns throughout Catalunya. Between 2009 and 2011 these informal votes for secession were collected and tallied with a resounding support of this movement from the local populace.</p>
								
								<p>As a result of these votes, and most likely because they sensed an impending larger movement toward independence, Catalunya’ autonomy statute created in 2006 had a provision stricken, one that was extremely important to the Catalan people. Its legal recognition as a nation within Spain. It also struck the provision that allowed the use of Catalan over Castellano throughout the region. In response the Catalan parliament voted to ban bullfighting, making it the only Spanish region to not participate, thus further differentiating the two groups culturally even further.
								</p>
								<p>In 2012 regional president Artur Mas is re-elected and joins forces with a separate political group both of which support fully Catalan independence, and to do so support holding a referendum on secession in their 2014 elections. From here on out much of the actions taken toward making their independence official is done and ratified in Catalunya. The start of this official move, after these preliminary votes, was the Catalan Parliament’s approval of their “declaration of sovereignty”. This declaration, which passed by a margin of 85 to 41 has no effective legal implication, but established rhetorically, the right to self-determination. This move may not have been official in the eyes of the country as it was official enough to rally Catalan natives toward independence on a grand scale.
								</p>
								<p>In 2014 Spain’s constitutional court rendered a decision on the declaration of sovereignty declaring it unconstitutional. While this slowed progress nationally, it only fueled the regional fires for independence. Throughout the remainder of 2014 President Artur Mas continued to push for non-binding referendum for November of that year under a different legal framework, and in November the informal vote took place. In this vote 80% of those who participated voted in favor of secession.
								</p>
								<p>After years of trying with limited success, and even political challenges within their own region, Catalunya finally struck a blow and edged a step closer to the independence for whch they have fought for centuries. In September of 2015 Pro-referendum parites win 87 of 135 seats in Catalan’s regional parliament, bringing the wish of 80% of the regions citizens’ one step closer to reality.
