								<h3>About the Author</h3>

								<p>
My name is Ryan Gilpin and I am currently a senior here at Bentley University. In addition to my LSM in Global Perspectives, I also have a major in Computer Information Systems and a minor in Spanish. A combination of the three of these was the motivation for this project: one with a thesis based in language, with a focus in a culture far different than mine, built on a website as its primary medium. I have been excited to take this project on for the last few years as I have been planning it with my advisor, Professor DeLeo.<br>
<br>I have studied Spanish for a very long time and it is a pet passion of mine that, while it isn’t my major focus of study, has been something that has influenced me throughout all of my other coursework as well. I even learned how to program and build websites using the same logic in which I learned Spanish. You have to say the right words in the proper order and the right tense to get a response that has any sort of meaning. In programming, to me, it is the same thing! If I don’t get the syntax right my website cannot elicit its beautiful response.<br>
<br>I hope you enjoy or have enjoyed this website and I hope that at the very least it opens you to the idea of another culture that, to many people, is completely new, interesting, and exciting.

								<h4>Photography</h4>
								<p>
I also have the small hobby of travel photography it all started with the gift of a fantastic camera that empowered me to chronicle my study abroad experience in Barcelona, and now I won’t go anywhere without it. Throughout the website there are a lot of photos that I myself have taken to support this project in different ways. My hope is that I have been able to incorporate my academic and personal passions into one complete project, which speaks to me as I am. <br><br> Below is the copyrighted gallery where I have posted all of the images that I took throughout my trip.
