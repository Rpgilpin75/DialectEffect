								<h3>Is Catalunya the Texas of Spain?</h3>
								<p>As an American, the first thing that comes to many of us when we hear the word “secede” is Texas. Well The short answer is no. While they share some similarities there are a few differences that really set the two apart. The details of much of this discussion are reviewed in greater detail in earlier Modern Politics pages. If you haven’t gotten a chance to skim those yet I would recommend doing so prior to this.</p>
								<p>As an American I found the fact that these informal secessionary votes actually took place extremely powerful. We here are used to states such as Texas claiming that they will secede if a specific person is elected, something controversial legalized, or something of the like, but above all else we know that that is almost impossible, even allowing the vote informally is next to impossible. In fact In Texas just last year that a proposal for an informal secession vote was denied. This is two regions of the world, with similarly fueled secessionary pasts attempting to do so.</p>
								<p>While the differences in acceptance and denial may be obviously binary, the differences in the two movements on an organizational level is not. Both are organized as states in a larger governed nation, with relative autonomy to influence politics on a national level through their own state governments, each have their own cultural identities by way of geography and historical influences, and both consequently are known for their “rebellious” spirit of sorts. Effectively similar in all major counts that could correlate their respective desires to be independent. The two seem to create a sort of formula for independence yet only one has seen any remotely tangible success. What is the missing piece of the formula that Texas does not have that Catalunya does?</p>
								<p>One word: Language.<br>
But I will be analyzing the merits of language as the missing piece to this “secession formula” in my deeper analysis of language (<a href="language.html">Here</a>). 
</p>							<p> Looking at the <a href="ProsConsSecession.html">Pros and Cons of Secession</a> there are also another few key differentiators and some of the arguments for and against the secession of Catalunya could also apply to Texas. First and foremost one of the major arguments for secession is the unequal partnership in regards to taxation to the national government. In Catalunya their contributions are significant and there are some regions, like the Basque Country, that are not required to pay any of these taxes. For Texas, that taxation inequality does not exist. Any differentials in taxes across the United States can be traced to different state policies in taxation, which exist in any established state to support infrastructure. Essentially, Texas does not meet that criteria. Even on the basis of culture where I make most of my argument in favor of Catalunya’s secession Texas cannot differentiate itself. Obviously Texas, as every other state, has its small differences regional culture, but in general it projects American ideals and liberties. There is also the fiscal argument to consider. Catalunya is a higher GDP producer than the rest of Spain combined, thus the fact that it has debt could be a direct result of having to compensate for the lack of production from the rest of Spain. Texas on the other hand in the year 2012 was ranked 14th in US GDP production. Not only did Texas not out produce every other state, it did not even come close to supporting the country as a whole with its own production thus eliminating the argument that Texas is at a financial loss as a result of its national association.</p>
