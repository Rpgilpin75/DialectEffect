								<h3>"Space for Free Expression"</h3>
								<p>Of every portion of this Catalan culture segment of my website, Catalan art is by far my favorite. As the mural above would suggest, after translation, is that Catalunya is a “Space for free expression.” To support that idea, it is home to some of the most incredible art and architecture, covered <a href="Architecture.html">here</a>, and continues to foster the growth of said art, continuously. From street exhibitions to formal art museums that house prized pieces from Joan Miro and Salvador Dali to name a few. Every day new art and artists emerge and thrive in this region. </p>

								<h4>Museu Nacional D'art De Catalunya</h4>
								<p>
The Museu Nacional D’art De Catalunya, also known as MNAC is the largest museum in Catalunya, filling the Palacio Nacional in Barcelona <img src="images/Cult-Art-MNAC.JPG" alt="MNAC" class="right" height="500px">. While it serves primarily as an art museum it is also serves as a hub of education in the Catalan artistic culture. Within its walls it contains art that span the centuries of Catalan history. MNAC has a deep rooted cultural collection extending from the age of Romanesque art, through Modernisme and even into the non-traditional art of the 20th and 21st centuries.<br><br>What I find most incredible about MNAC is that, one, it is an art institution that focuses on teaching and spreading the Catalan culture through art, and two, that they maintain their connection to the Catalan artists of today. This willingness to look for and display art from modern artists is essential to the spirit of the region. People in Catalunya grow up knowing that if art is what they look to pursue as a career then their country will support them, and in turn it allows those artists to continue supporting the Catalan identity in their own way.</p>

								<h4>Joan Miro</h4>
								<p>Catalan native and surreal artist Joan Miro made a massive name for himself on the international art scene. He influenced many great artists such as Salvador Dali. Born in 1893 in Barcelona, Miro created works in sculpture, painting, and even ceramics. A lot of his works were influenced by that city and the style of the artists that existed within it. He enrolled in the School of Industrial & Fine Arts in 1910.  </p>
								<p><img src="images/Cult-Art-Miro.JPG" class="left" alt="Miro Foundation" height="400px">Many of the paintings throughout his career contained similar imagery, even in his most surreal and abstract pieces one symbol in particular: a ladder. It is a symbol so significant that an entire exhibition was opened to map the symbol’s connection to his entire life. The exhibition highlights his engagement with his country and the time period in which he lived. A life of art that are directly intertwined with the history of the region as well.</p>
								<p>Joan Miro also created the Fundacio Joan Miro, translated to the Joan Miro Foundation, filled with art from his own private collection intending on creating an internationally recognized center in the heart of Catalunya for contemporary art research. Not only did Miro set the groundwork for other Catalan artists, but set his life on creating a center of art in Catalunya for all to enjoy and grow from.</p>

								<h4>Salvador Dali</h4>
								<p><img src="images/Dali-Persistencia de la memoria!.JPG" class="right" alt="Persistencia de la Memoria" height="300px">
								Of the above mentioned artists, all of whom have had a significant impact on Catalan culture, none is more iconic than the Catalan surrealist Salvador Dali, who is also my personal favorite artist. Born in 1904 in Figueres, Catalunya Dali has experienced much of the regions turbulent history firsthand. Dali was involved not only in painting for which he is most famous, but in sculpture, print, fashion, advertising, writing, and even filmmaking in which he collaborated with famous directors such as Alfred Hitchcock. He is known worldwide for his outrageous personality.</p>
								<p>
								One of his most iconic pieces was La Persistencia de la Memoria, or The Persistance of Memory (right). This painting is generally interpreted to show Dali’s rejection of the assumption that time is a rigid form of measurement, but instead flows and transcends. Dali Spent time in Both Madrid and Paris forming his artistic identity and spent time studying art not simply academically, but also with the great Pablo Picasso who, alongside Joan M<img src="images/DaliMuseum.JPG" class="left" alt="Museum in Figueres" height="300px">iro, had a large effect on Dali’s personal expression.</p>
								<p>&nbsp;Dali Passed away in 1989 and was buried in a museum built in his home town of Figueres, Spain which houses the lifetime of art he had created, a replica of his very own bedroom, and various rotating exhibits for modern surreal artists. Even in his death he continues to inspire native Catalan artists to pursue their passions. In true Dali Fashion his museum was built using his Iconic Surreal style.</p><br>
