								<h3>Catalunya Since the Start of 2016</h3>
								<p><img src="images/poli-Carles_Puigdemont_2016.jpg" class="right" alt="Carles Puigdemont">
								As of January 12th, 2016 Catalunya has elected a new president for the Generalitat, Carles Puigdemont. Puigdemont has now taken up the mantle for Catalunya in their fight for independence. The former mayor of the Catalan City of Girona believes that he has a way to bring Catalunya its independence without having to receive the support of the national government in Madrid. While he says that he is “hoping to achieve a broader deal with the Spanish government,” he also insists that “a unilateral breakaway was also possible” (FT). Puigdemont has an interesting idea on the idea of Catalan independence in that “If madrid does not want an accord and the majority of Catalans want an independent state, how can you avoid that” (FT). Essentially saying, by what capacity could the national Spanish government stop Catalunya from attaining its independence if that is what the people want? A scary sentiment for many Spanish nationals because it suggests that regardless of the outcome they still may not be able to prevent the severing of these two states.</p>
								<p>Puigdemont does however state that he does in fact want the backing of Spain and will attempt to gain that backing in any way necessary. His continued arguments with the national Corts state that Catalunya’s claims are not only legitimate but also completely legal in that they already have a mature government established in their Generalitat parliament and that they decide what a legal and legitimate decision for the region is. This more radical approach to secession is concerning the Spanish national government because it suggests again that they will secede at any cost. 
								</p>
								<p>This movement is continuing to develop even now, so watch closely as Catalunya attempts is full secessionary move.</p>
